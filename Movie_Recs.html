            <i>Almost Famous</i> follows a 15-year-old journalist who through a series of lucky
            circumstances gets assigned to write an article for <i>Rolling Stones</i> magazine about
            the up-and-coming band Stillwater. Labled as the enemy, this cunning kid
            goes on tour with the band and along the way learns the many truths
            behind the shiny rock star lifestyle. This coming of age film is wonderfully witty and truly
            touching. It stands as one of my favorite films to watch over and over again.</p>

                In this comedy, King Arthur goes on a quest to seek out the Holy Grail.
                For the journey, he travels throughout Britain in search of worthy
                men to join his Knights of the Round Table. He ends up recruiting
                Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure
                and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot for this holy quest.
                These brave adventurers face many trials in their travels such as a blood
                thirsty bunny, disagreeable French soldiers, and a feisty bridge-keeper.
                This incredibly silly film never fails to make me laugh.</p>

                    <i>Zombieland</i> is an action packed film of blood and gore that follows
                    a college student as he navigates the zombie apocalypse. He’s
                    made it this far by sticking to his long list of safety rules.
                    In attempts to find a place free of zombies, he makes his way
                    to Los Angeles and links up with three strangers. Along the way, they
                    kill tons of zombies, search high and low for Twinkies and murder
                    the famous Bill Murray. It ranks as one of the most aggressive,
                    heartwarming comedies I’ve ever seen.</p>

                        Set back in time to some point soon after the Civil War,
                        this movie stars eight untrustworthy strangers who find
                        themselves trapped at an inn during a blizzard. The group is
                        filled with suspicion for one another and tensions rise as time
                        passes. Filled with twists and turns, this film will have you
                        wondering just what exactly is going on right until the end. It
                        is of the most entertaining films I’ve seen and only one of
                        Quentin Tarantino’s masterpieces.</p>

                            This film focusses on a Will Hunting, a 20-year-old janitor
                            at MIT college. His intellect had gone unrecognized throughout
                            his life until a professor at the college discovers him solving
                            a complex mathematics problem. Instead of going to jail for
                            assaulting a police officer, Will is offered the chance to study
                            under the professor so long as he attends therapy. After scaring
                            off multiple therapists, Will gets put into the care of Dr. Sean
                            Maguire. Through therapy, Will is able to build healthier
                            relationships with the people in his life and plan for his future.
                            This film will always be one of my all time favorites.</p>
